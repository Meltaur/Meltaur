Hi! I'm Wojtek and I study Automation Engineering and Robotics at Gdańsk University of Technology. While studying i discovered that programing projects are the ones that I'm most
intrested in and they give me the most satisfaction. That's why my baechelor's thesis was entirely focused on IT problem. I've made a website using languages, frameworks and
technologies such as:
- Javascript
- React.js
- Python
- Flask
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS

I'm currently working on improving my Python skills. I have finished codecademy course regarding Python 3 and I'm working on a project using this language.

I'm looking for a remote or stacionary(Trójmiasto, Poland) internship as front-end or full-tack developer.
